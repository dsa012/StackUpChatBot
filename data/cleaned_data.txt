1. What is this quest about? The "How To Earn Rewards in StackUp" quest was recently launched to help new users understand how to navigate the platform. This is atemporary initiativethat we plan to experiment with for a few weeks.  2. Who can participate in this quest? This quest is exclusive to new users who fall into one of the following categories:  Users who recently signed up to StackUp from April 2024 onwards or  Users who have never submitted any quests previously   3. I am not a new user. What will happen if I submit this quest? This quest is for new users only. Submissions from any other users will be rejected.  4. Why can't existing active users participate in this quest? To our existing active users, we understand that you may feel disappointed that this opportunity is not available to you. To provide you with more context, the StackUp team periodically conducts experiments targeted at various segments of our user community to test out more effective methods of enhancing your platform experience. The "How To Earn Rewards in StackUp" campaign is one such experiment, specifically designed to improve the experience of new users. Please be assured that we deeply value your ongoing support and engagement, and will continue to strive to provide rewarding experiences for all users.  5. Battle Royale: can I earn Battle Points by completing this quest? This quest is excluded from [Battle Royale](https://stackuphelpcentre.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/27883255989145" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer). As such, completion of this quest will not earn you any Battle Points.

What is Learn &amp; Earns Reward Mechanism? Since Learn &amp; Earn started, we have always rewarded players on a first-come, first-served basis. This means that the fastest players to submit a quest receive rewards. In response to user feedback highlighting the challenge of earning rewards and the pressure to quickly complete quests, Learn &amp; Earn is trying out a new reward distribution system. This change is intended to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to earn rewards for their effort and hard work, even if they may not be able to participate right away when a quest launches. We want to continue rewarding our very dedicated players who are there at 1200 hrs GMT+8 to start questing, so a portion of the rewards will be reserved for the fastest players. The remaining rewards will be distributed via the new mechanism. For all quests included in this experimental reward mechanism, it will be stated explicitly in the quests introduction. How it works? Example 1: Random Allocation Mechanism Imagine a scenario where a quest provides 1500 rewards, each valued at $1, and 2000 players submit their entries. 1000 rewards are reserved for the fastest players. This means that the fastest 1000 players are guaranteed with the $1 reward. The remaining 500 rewards are randomly distributed among the 1000 approved players who weren't the fastest to submit. Each of these remaining players has a 50% chance of receiving a reward. Example 2: Even Distribution Mechanism Imagine a scenario where a quest provides 1500 rewards, each valued at $1, totalling a prize pool of $1500. 2000 players have submitted their entries.1000 rewards are reserved for the fastest players. This means that the fastest 1000 players are guaranteed with the $1 reward. After distributing $1000 to the fastest players, $500 remains in the prize pool. This remaining amount is then evenly divided among the remaining 1000 approved players who have not received a reward yet. Consequently, each of these players will receive 50 cents.  FAQs  1.How will I know if I am one of the fastest players to receive a reward?Your quest status will be rewarded and you can also view your reward in your list of transactions on the "Balance &amp; Request History" page found under "My Balance". 2. How is the random allocation conducted?We will use a seed for a random number generator (RNG). The RNG will then generate a list of numbers which will correspond to a players submission number. 3. How will I know if I have been rewarded in the random allocation mechanism?As this mechanism is still in the experimental stage, users who are rewarded via the new mechanism will see the approved status. However, you can view transactions on the "Balance &amp; Request History" page found under "My Balance". If you are rewarded, you will see your reward for the quest as a transaction. 4. How can I provide feedback on the new reward mechanism? You can visit our Discord server and head to the [[ideas-and-feedback channel](https://discord.com/channels/895564164783808523/895572257466875924)] channel to share your thoughts.Disclaimer: This initiative is currently in the experimental phase, with potential changes to how it works. It will undergo limited testing for a while and its future implementation is still uncertain. Any updates will be communicated clearly.

Email Address UpdateThe update of email addresses will be handled on a case-by-case basis, subject to specific criteria that must be met before the process can commence. You can submit a [ticket](https://stackuphelpcentre.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=9094359542041) for assistance.

About Battle Royale Battle Royale is a monthly showdown among all Stackies where you can compete, defend and dethrone one another for limited spots on the Battle Royale leaderboard! At the end of each month, a maximum of top 50 Stackies will get a special role icon next to your Discord username as a testament of your hard work and success.  When: Monthly from February to April 2024 only Where: StackUp Discords [#Battle-Royale channel](https://discord.com/channels/895564164783808523/1202524099696394311" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer)    How it works    Auto-register your participation [here](https://forms.gle/Aipo2gydfLh1dBwL6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer)  Accumulate Battle Points to compete for spots on the Battle Royale Leaderboard. As leaderboard spots are limited, try your best tooutperform your peers!  Last day of each month: Stackies who made it to the leaderboard will receive a special role icon.  First day of each new month: all Battle Points will reset to zero and the battle restarts. Even if youve earned a role icon in the previous month, you will lose the role icon in the next month if you fail to maintain your leaderboard spot. This is to give all users a fair chance at competing in the next month.    Frequently Asked Questions  Q1: How to get Battle Points?Each month, complete StackUp quests &amp; bounties to earn Battle Points:- 1 quest submission = 1 point- 1 bounty submission = 1.5 point- E.g. if you submit 10 quests and 2 bounties from 1st to 30th March 2024, you'll earn = (10 x 1) + (1.5 x 2) = 13 Battle Points in MarchNote: any submission that is blank, featuring placeholder text/image and/or completely unrelated to the quest or bounty content will not be awarded any Battle Points. Q2: Can I check my progress during the battle?On the 15th of every month, we will release the mid-month results in the #Battle-royale Discord channel to help you understand where you stand among your peers. In this update, you will be able to find out:- Who are the top Stackies so far- How many Battle Points these users have gotten so far Q3: What if multiple Stackies have the same Battle Points?These Stackies will share the same leaderboard rank and get the same role icon. Q4: Since the battle restarts monthly, what will happen to the role icon that I won last month?For instance, if you've successfully earned a spot in Februarys leaderboard, you will receive your role icon on the last day of the month (i.e. 29 Feb). The role icon will remain with you until Marchs leaderboard results have been revealed (i.e. 31 Mar).  If your leaderboard rank in March is the same as Feb, you get to keep your role icon for another month. If your leaderboard rank in March is different from Feb, your role icon will change according to your new rank on 31 Mar. If you no longer made it into the leaderboard in March, you will lose your role icon on 31 Mar.    Q5: How do the ranks/role icons look like?In each month's Battle Royale, up to a maximum of top 50 Stackies will be able to win one of the following role icons. Depending on how fierce the competition is, please note that some roles may not be awarded to users in certain months. For instance, if the top 50 Stackies are already occupying ranks 1 to 5, there will be no roles given out for ranks 6 to &gt;10 in that month.   Q6: I've gotten a role icon! How do I view it? Type something in our StackUp Discord channels! You, along with everyone else in StackUp's Discord, will be able to see the role icon next to your Discord username.  Alternatively, within the StackUp Discord server, click on your Discord username and you'll be able to view your role icon! Anyone else who clicks onto your username will be able to see your role as well.   Q7: What happens after 30 April 2024?Currently, Battle Royale will end on 30 April 2024 as this is a new initiative that we're testing out for a short-term period. Depending on Stackies' participation, we may or may not decide to further extend the competition. Stackies with role icons as of 30 April can continue to keep your role icon moving beyond.

Abuse Reporting: Users are encouraged to report any form of platform abuse, including cheating, harassment, or violations of this policy through privately messaging our Community Moderators or using the [General Enquiry form](https://stackuphelpcentre.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=9094359542041).

All abuse reports will be treated with utmost confidentiality, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that you can use our platform without fear of retaliation or exposure when reporting abusive behaviour.   Appeal: Our quests are intentionally designed to make it difficult for users who complete the content on their own to submit work that is similar enough to be suspected of being a copied submission. A manual review is also conducted by our team for users who have been flagged for suspicious activity to ensure accuracy. However, users who believe that they have been mistakenly flagged for cheating can submit an appeal through our StackUp Help Centre [Submission-Related-Matters Form](https://stackuphelpcentre.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=11733869435673). Appeals will be carefully re-reviewed by our team; however, please note that we cannot guarantee that a second review is done for every case and reserve the right to uphold our decision based on the evidence available.

You can check your balance from your [StackUp Profile Page](https://app.stackup.dev/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer).  How do I claim the reward? The rewards are automatically credited to your rewards balance that you can view by clicking the "Profile" tab.

Step 1 - Fill in [this](https://stackuphelpcentre.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=10970588074137) request form.Step 2 - Please provide the required screenshot of your StackUp Learn and Earn's "My Profile" Pageas shown below before submitting the form. Step 3 - Please submit a screenshot or electronic copy of your billing statement along with one form of identification, such as a passport, national identity card, or birth certificate. If you've recently changed your nationality, please include your passport, certificate of citizenship, or certificate of nationality.Important notes:  If you are using bank transfers via WISE to receive your rewards, please ensure to provide updated bank details if you wish to change your country of residence. This is important because it will affect the currency that we send to you. Your Country of Residence (COR) and bank details all must match to avoid any delays or future troubleshooting. Additionally, please note that there are countries that our WISE partner may not be able to support. Check it out [here.](WISE%20Supported%20Countries%20and%20Regions)  Failure to provide both the billing statement and one form of identification will result in the request not being processed. Additionally, if the screenshot lacks essential details or if proof of identification and billing information are incomplete, your request will not proceed.

As part of our ongoing efforts to ensure StackUp complies with applicable laws and regulations, we are implementing changes to the scope of countries supported by our platform - effective as of 09 November 2022.With these changes, our platform will, unfortunately, be unable to support specific regions/countries and Stackies from the regions/countries listed below. This applies if the Stackie is residing in the unsupported country or a citizen of the unsupported country.  The Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (North Korea) The Republic of Sudan Russia  The Islamic Republic of Iran The Republic of Cuba Ukraine The Syrian Arab Republic The State of Libya The Federal Republic of Somalia The Republic of Yemen The Democratic Republic of the Congo  Why are these countries not supported? StackUp, our campaign partners, and our payment providers are all businesses that are legally responsible for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. After having reviewed and identified such applicable regulations, we have found that we are restricted from supporting Stackies from the listed countries. In some cases, we or our campaign partners are not able to award quest rewards to Stackies from certain regions. In other cases, our payment providers are unable to pay out to Stackies from certain regions. In conclusion, we find ourselves unable to pay out rewards to Stackies in the listed countries, despite our desire to do so.

It is possible to use another persons bank account number linked to your StackUp account. However, it is strictly prohibited to use the same bank details under two different accounts.

Players will provide StackUp with their bank account details, allowing StackUp to use WISE to send the reward money direct to the players' bank accounts. Players will receive the reward money in their local currency. The currency exchange rate is provided by WISE.Please note that StackUp can only ensure that withdrawal requests are successfully sent to the provided payment details.Regrettably, we are unable to provide any assurances about any events that occur after the successful transaction.

StackUp currently supports two payment methods. A. Bank transfer StackUp uses WISE to do bank transfers, with players receiving the reward in their local currency direct in their bank account. B. USDC stablecoin (cryptocurrency) via AVAX StackUp sends USDC and it maintains a 1:1 ratio with USD. So the amount of USD withdrawn = the amount of USDC received. Important: Some countries may not be supported by each payment method.

After a quest has reached its deadline, the quest master (creator of the quest) will review all submissions. You will expect to know the result of your submission 10 days after the quest ends.  Review Submission Status:  Rewarded - If your submission meets the requirements of the deliverables stated, you will be rewarded. You can check your balance from your [StackUp Profile Page](https://app.stackup.dev/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer). Please note that the reward pool is limited in number. Approved - Rewards are limited and are given out to qualified submissions on a first-come-first-serve basis. If there are no more rewards left, your submission will only be approved. (see [Most of my submissions are only "approved" - what can I do?](https://stackuphelpcentre.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/10826376996505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer)) Rejected - The reviewers will indicate the appropriate reason for your rejection which you may see from the quest page pop-up box.

We strongly advise against joining the new StackUp Learn &amp; Earn as the suspension on the old StackUp platform also extends to the new platform. While you can participate in quests, earn rewards, and perhaps be able to submit a withdrawal request on the new platform, there's a high risk of cancellation or failure, and StackUp will not be held responsible for any accumulated reward amounts affected by observed suspension records from the old platform.

From late December 2023 to the end of January 2024, we offered a balance transfer feature in the old StackUp platform for users with an account balance below $10 while encouraging those with balances exceeding $10 to withdraw their funds from the old platform. However, the deadline for this transfer was set on January 30, 2024. Please be aware that the old StackUp platform ceased its operations completely. Access to your old account, including transaction history and wallet balance, will no longer be available. If you encounter any issues following the platform's closure, please contact our support team by creating a [ticket](https://stackuphelpcentre.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=9094359542041). FAQ: Q: What happens if I don't withdraw my balance over $10 from the old StackUp Platform?Effective January 30, 2024, the old StackUp platform has been sunsetted. If you have balances exceeding $10 remaining on the old platform, we strongly urge you to utilise the [Balance Transfer Feature](https://stackuphelpcentre.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/26697294432153-The-Balance-Transfer-Feature-to-Learn-and-Earn-v2-0-is-now-Available-)found on your old platform's profile page.Failure to transfer your balance to the new StackUp Learn &amp; Earn platform before the complete cessation of the old StackUp platform (anticipated shortly after January 30) may result in the loss of access to your funds. Q: What happens if my balance is below $10 in the old platform and I'm unable to make a withdrawal? On January 30, 2024, the old StackUp platform has been sunsetted. If you have balances below $10 remaining on the old platform, please contact our support team by creating a [ticket](https://stackuphelpcentre.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).Failure to transfer your balance to the new StackUp Learn &amp; Earn platform after the complete cessation of the old StackUp platform on January 30 may result in the loss of access to your funds.  Q: Why was my balance transfer request rejected? Rejected requests typically occur when we can't locate your registered email address from the New StackUp Learn &amp; Earn. To proceed, please sign up for a new account on the [StackUp Learn &amp; Earn platform](https://stackup.dev/) and ensure it is verified.

Should I use the same email address that I use for the StackUp Early Access v1.0 to sign up for the StackUp Learn &amp; Earn? While it is not mandatory, we highly recommend using the same email address for StackUp Learn and Earn so that you do not have to create a new Zendesk account for our customer support and we can view the ticket history consistently across the old and the new platform. Do I need to enter the same payment details that I used for StackUp Early Access? No, it is not mandatory to use the same payment details that you used for StackUp Early Access. However, it is important to note that sharing withdrawal details with another user is a violation of StackUps [policy](https://stackuphelpcentre.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/14693360046233-Platform-Integrity). Where can I provide my feedback?  If you encounter a bug, have suggestions and ideas or have any other related questions about the new platform, kindly send us a [request form](https://stackuphelpcentre.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=23846606328857&amp;utm_source=ActiveCampaign&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=%5B%F0%9F%8E%89+Exclusive+Invite%5D+You+ve+been+selected+for+our+first+wave+of+Beta+testing+for+our+new+StackUp+platform%21&amp;utm_campaign=A+Sneak+Peak+into+Learn+++Earn+2+0+%28Edited%29) through our [Help Centre](https://stackuphelpcentre.zendesk.com/hc/en-us).

Yes, collaborative efforts can be valuable, especially for intricate challenges that require diverse expertise. It's permissible to collaborate with colleagues while working on a bounty. However, please bear in mind that when it comes to reward distribution, the reward will be credited to the account responsible for submitting the deliverable. If you wish to distribute the reward among group members, that decision is entirely yours. It's important to note that once the reward is disbursed to the designated account, StackUp holds no responsibility for any arrangements regarding the division of the reward among the group members.

Players will provide StackUp with their AVAX wallet address for receiving tokens on the C-chain. StackUp will send USDC(AVAX C-chain) tokens directly to the wallet address provided. Stackies must ensure that their wallet address can receive C-chain tokens.USDC maintains a 1:1 ratio with USD. So the amount of USD withdrawn = the amount of USDC received. Important notes: StackUp will send USDC tokens to the provided addresses. If players wish to convert USDC tokens to USD or other tokens, they need to secure their own AVAX tokens for transaction fees and find an online token exchange that serves their region and performs the conversion themselves. Please note that StackUp can only ensure that withdrawal requests are successfully sent to the provided payment details. Regrettably, we are unable to provide any assurances about any events that occur after the successful transaction.

If your withdrawal is on hold, it could be due to two reasons: a. Your payment is still being processed.     If you haven't received an email from StackUp requesting you to check your payment details, and your reward hasn't arrived in your bank account or wallet address, please wait until the 7th day from your request date. There's a good chance that your transaction is already in the queue for payout and processing. b. There's an issue with your bank withdrawal details.  We'll send you an email within 2-4 days from your withdrawal date to notify you of the problem. This could be due to incorrect or insufficient bank details.  If your withdrawal has been rejected, it may be due to one of the following reasons: a. Your account has been suspended.    You should have received an email notification regarding the suspension of your account. Please check your email for this notification. b. Your account is currently under observation and is being reviewed by the relevant team.   You will receive notifications regarding any suspicious activity associated with your account.    Please check your email for any communication from us regarding this matter. c. You may have requested a cancellation and refund.    To confirm this, you can review any past or ongoing tickets you have with us via email. d. Your country of residence is not supported by our Crypto payment partner or by WISE.    We'll send you an email within 2-4 days from your withdrawal date to notify you of the problem and we will refund you back the reward amount. e. Your Crypto wallet address is incorrect   There is no email expected for this matter. You will see this as a reason for your rejected withdrawal request under your profile's transaction history.Please ensure to check your inbox, including the spam/junk folder, and respond accordingly to any emails with follow-up actions. If you haven't received an email and it's been more than 7 days since your withdrawal date, please submit a request using this [form](https://stackuphelpcentre.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=11749552676121).

Users from these countries, whether residing in the region or citizens of it, will not be able to perform certain actions, including but not limited to submitting quests, earning monetary rewards, and making withdrawal requests. However, the affected Stackies will still be able to interact with other Stackies on Discord community channels.

StackUp allows players to withdraw their rewards, with the following conditions:  Players must be willing and able to accept rewards by at least one of our two payment methods (see below for more information). There is a minimum withdrawal sum of $10 USD, and users can only withdraw their entire balance at one time. Regrettably, there is a withdrawal fee to help the StackUp team cope with the transfer costs.  For withdrawals between $10-25 (including $25), there is a 10% fee. For withdrawals between $25-50 (excluding $25), there is a 5% fee. For withdrawals more than $50, there is a 2% fee.   Please note that StackUp can only ensure that withdrawal requests are successfully sent to the provided payment details.Regrettably, we are unable to provide any assurances about any events that occur after the successful transaction.

Since submissions are reviewed on a first-come-first-serve basis, your best chance to get the reward will be to quickly complete the quest as soon as it is available.

Stackies flagged for suspicious activity will receive email notifications and submission reason codes based on the type of cheating involved. Expect an email within 1-5 working days regarding actions taken on your account. Below are two scenarios you might encounter when flagged, along with their implications and suggested actions. Scenario 1: Your quest submission has been flagged for suspicious activity, and you have received a warning email. However, your account has not been suspended. StackUp Platform Rejection Feedback: "Your account has been flagged for suspicious activity. Please see the Guide for more info." Email Notifications Regarding Your Recent Submission (Warning) If you receive this email, your account is not suspended. This indicates that the warning pertains only to a specific quest and will not affect your future quest submissions. However, your account will be closely monitored and may be suspended if the team observes or identifies other suspicious indicators.  Scenario 2: Your quest submission has been rejected because your account is suspended and is currently under investigation. StackUp Platform Rejection Feedback: Your account is currently under investigation for suspension. We will not be considering your deliverable. Email Notifications  Your Account is on Temporary Suspension: Duplicated Bank Details Detected  Your Account is on Temporary Suspension: Duplicated Wallet Details Detected Account Suspension Notification Your account may be suspended due to a violation of our policy, and the specific reason may constitute the below:   2.1 Your account has been temporarily suspended due to duplicated withdrawal details detected. As sharing withdrawal details constitutes cheating under our policy, your account may be temporarily suspended and withdrawal features will be restricted until this is resolved. Stackies should follow the email notification for instructions on updating their withdrawal details and having their features resumed. If our investigation determines that your account can be lifted from the temporary suspension, please note that any past submissions submitted during the suspension will not be reviewed again. However, rest assured that future submissions will not be affected unless another suspicious activity is observed.    2.2 Your account has been suspended due to flagged suspicious activity. Our policy follows a zero-tolerance approach towards Stackies who engage in cheating and/or exploitative measures to gain an unfair advantage towards the prize pool money. Stackies who are found to have breached StackUp's policy multiple times will have their account suspended, rewards revoked, withdrawals restricted, and you will no longer have access to your Learn &amp; Earn account. Suspended users will also not be allowed to create a new account on our platform.

Our StackUp team believes in Stackies finding their solution by constructive collaboration. To better facilitate this process, we have created a forum in our Discord server, in [quest-help-forum](https://discord.com/channels/895564164783808523/1060491074109456454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer). Please read through the rules template for easier navigation of the space.   Moreover, you can stay updated by tuning in to our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/+yLz1VKd8grk2MGUy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer) and [Discord announcement channel](https://discord.gg/fHasQxteqT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer). These channels will notify you of new campaigns, quest starts, and bounty opportunities. Additionally, the [Discord announcement channel](https://discord.gg/fHasQxteqT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer) will post the appropriate and dedicated help desk channel per campaign nearing its launch date. These help desk channels will be expected to have tailored responses and discussions solely about a specific campaign/ quest.

To begin, Stackies should follow the steps below:Step 1 - Set up a wallet compatible with the Avalanche network. We will recommend using the Core Wallet as it has been tested and used by the StackUp team. For guidance, Stackies can find more information on the Core Wallet [here]. Step 2 - Ensure that the wallet is capable of receiving tokens on the C-chain. Obtain the C-chain wallet address, beginning with "0x," and enter it into the cryptocurrency field on the platform.Step 3 - Once you have your public address on the C-chain, if you are using the old platform, navigate to the [StackUp profile page](https://app.stackup.dev/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer), click on the "Profile" tab, then select "Withdraw." From there, choose "Add Avalanche wallet" and complete the required fields as prompted.If you are utilising the new platform, go to your [Learn &amp; Earn Account management](https://community.campus.dev/web?sid=space_16a69442-cb83-4027-85b0-ca5f1d7e650b&amp;target_path=%2Flearners%2Fmy%2Ffinances%2Fwithdrawal_methods) &gt; click "Finance" page &gt; click "Manage Withdrawal" &gt; click the "My Crypto Wallets".

FIAT When you receive an email where your transfer gets cancelled, please note we do not cancel the transfer manually, rather this occurs when there is some error(s) with the withdrawal details that you provided and when our banking partner's payment system attempted to make the transfer, it was unable to do so successfully, automatically cancelled the transfer and refunded the rewards back to us. Check out [ Why is my withdrawal on hold?](https://stackuphelpcentre.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/14803635509785" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer) and find out how to rectify the issue.

Where to find the reason for rejection? The reviewers will indicate the appropriate reason for your rejection which you may see from the quest page pop-up box.   Reason for rejection: A.

We understand that Stackies may want some visibility as to why they have been suspended or flagged, however our internal processes and data privacy considerations prohibit us from sharing specific evidence or details related to individual cases. Please understand that this measure is in place to protect not only the privacy of the users involved but also the integrity of our detection methods. While we are unable to provide details that would include other users personal data, submissions or other sensitive processes, we will still outline the steps that we took as due diligence so you are aware of the steps that have been taken. Our decisions are not taken lightly and are based on a careful review of available information, a commitment to maintaining fairness for all users, and a strong commitment to user privacy. We appreciate your understanding and support as we continue to strive for a positive and secure platform experience for all users.

We understand your frustration that you were only approved for the quests despite your best efforts. Our quests are in high demand and highly competitive as our Stackies seek to be rewarded for their efforts. We receive a large number of submissions and we reward submissions based on a first-come-first-served basis. Once the rewards have been given out, the rest of the submissions are approved. If you wish to be rewarded, we would advise you to attempt the quest and submit it as early as you can. Generally, our Stackies who submit on the day of the quest start date have a very high likelihood of being rewarded.

What are pre-requisite Quests? There might be special conditions to join certain quests. Some quests may have pre-requisite quests. In such cases, you need to have at least joined the pre-requisite quest, before you can join the next quest.  What are the repeated Quests? Some quests may be repeated quests of previous quests. In such cases, if you ever submitted AND got a reward for the previous quest, you will be unable to join this new repeated quest, to give other players a fair chance.

StackUp employs various advanced detection software, as well as AI and machine learning models, to identify suspicious user behaviour, submissions, and other activities on our platform. These automated systems alert us to certain high-risk signals and indicators for investigation, which are then complemented by human intervention for a thorough review to ensure that our checks are comprehensive and multi-layered. Below briefly outlines the steps that we use to detect on cheating users and submission, which includes but not limited to:  Identification of highly suspicious activity (submissions and user behaviours) through system detection against various resources, users' platform behaviour, and account history. Manual human intervention for further investigation and review of flagged users and/or activity before concluding that suspicious activity has taken place.

StackUp Quests require Stackies to follow a specific set of learning instructions to achieve the same outcome. [Bounties](https://earn.stackup.dev/) are more open-ended. Bounty hunters may use different code, or choose to build different featuresdepending on the Bounty. Since Bounties are more complex, they will also generally include higher reward sums. If you have been disappointed because Quest rewards have run out before your submission, youll love Bounties! Bounties are rewarded on quality. During the review period, our reviewers will go through all submissions to select and reward only the best ones. So dont rush to submit! Make sure you work hard to deliver the best quality work within the Bounty availability period.

If you are unable to withdraw your reward balance, there are a few likely reasons for this.1. You have not yet linked any payment methods on StackUp. The withdrawal button is only available for users who have added a payment method to our system.2. Your reward balance is below $10. Our current minimum sum for withdrawal is USD 10. This is primarily to combat the high transaction fees involved in sending money to our players.

StackUp's commitment to fairness is backed by a robust cheating detection system. This involves advanced analytics with human intervention and reviews to ensure that our developers have a maintained fair environment where efforts are recognised and rewarded fairly. If a submission is initially approved or rewarded but is later found to be unfairly graded, StackUp takes action by clawing back the rewards gained unfairly. This is essential to maintain the integrity of our platform. Please read our [Platform Integrity Policy](https://stackuphelpcentre.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/14693329082649--Platform-Integrity-Policy" target="_self) to gain a better understanding.

If you haven't participated in the relevant quest, not to worry! For bounties that build off of quests, we will link the relevant quest directly in the bounty to direct you to the appropriate learning content. Here, you will find step-by-step instructions starting from the basics to gain sufficient knowledge to participate and submit a high-quality bounty deliverable.
